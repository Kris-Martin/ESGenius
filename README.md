## Description
### Data Approach
- We have utilised a 5 step data approach to approach our pipeline from data collection to analysis and visualization.
- We present our insights as a dashboard
- We have used data sets from Australian and International bodies to conduct our analysis
- We have developed a proof-of-concept to test the concept of social and green initiatives
1 Data Sources: Your ESG data is stored across government departments, businesses and individuals. These sources are generally used for extraction of data
2. Data Collection: Data is ingested from various data sources. This data may be unstructured, semi-structured or unstructured
3. Data Processing: Your data is validated for any errors, cleaned and transformed for further processing
4. Data Storage: The data is stored in large data storages such as large data warehouses and data lakes ready for analysis
5. Data Visualisation: We perform predictive analysis and visualisation on ESG metrics across Australia. This can help to track and comply with relevant legislations.
